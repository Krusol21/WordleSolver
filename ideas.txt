We are keeping track of possible solutions, by pruning the possible solutions
set using pruning.py (called it solutions_words)

For algorithm
1. Information Gain algorithm
Steps:
1st: Make a set of possible words (information_words) that do not have any guessed letters from possibles and targets
We could also make the information_words contain yellow to figure out order (as long as they are not in a guessed location)

Current heuristic: Choose based on most vowels (naive heuristic)

A threshold/condition to switch to 2
- If the list of information_words is empty, go to 2
- If the list does not decrease enough, go to 2
- If the length of guessing_words is less than the amout of gueses left
- If we are on the last guess

2. Guessing word algorithm
Guess based on possible solutions_words
Will be pruned and probably will only have to run 1-2 times max.
